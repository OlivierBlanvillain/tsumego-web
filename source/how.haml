			### The books

			Back in 2006, before I had any idea how to code, I created a
			monster. Started with sgf files containing the problem collections,
			wrote an [awful Perl
			script](https://github.com/tasuk/tsumego/blob/master/scripts/rotate.pl)
			rotating the problems to the upper left corner. (Hey, it's just 100
			lines of code and actually *does* something. These days I write
			thousands of lines of code to do nothing much at all.)

			Then used sgf2dg (back when it was called sgf2tex!) to spit out TeX
			output.  PdfTeX to get pdfs and voila.

			This would be a good place to thank [Toxygen](http://toxygen.me/).
			Do you know how Metafont fonts look when processed with pdfTeX?
			Fucking ugly. I spent weeks trying to convert the Metafont go
			diagram fonts into PostScript format. Then Majo came along and
			converted them, I still have no idea how he did it. If you ever
			want to produce go pdf's from TeX, get the [PostScript
			fonts](https://github.com/tasuk/tsumego/tree/master/fonts).

			### The goban picture

			The header picture (my favorite tsumego -- no ko!) was done in
			[POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/), which is an amazing piece of
			software that went missing from Ubuntu repos recently. Screw
			Ubuntu.

			### The website

			7 years after launch -- 2013 AD -- seems like the right time to
			drop the "Beta" and refresh the website a little. Also a good
			opportunity to finally try out [Twitter
			Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). And since static
			site generation is all the rage these days and Jekyll is not hip
			enough anymore, it's done with
			[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/).
